# My FreeCodeCamp Python Journey

This repository documents my learning progress through the FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python curriculum, each folder contains a hands-on project I built to understand core programming concepts.  

All scripts written personally and include a README.md to learn the *why* behind every line of code.
