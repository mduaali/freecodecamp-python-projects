bisection_square_root.py 

this project finds the square root of a number using the bisection method, a numerical technique for approximating solutions.

**what it does:**
takes a number as input and iteratively narrows down the range of possible values until the guess squared is close enough to the target number. handles numbers greater than, less than, or equal to 1, and checks for negative inputs.

**what i learned:**
how to implement a numerical method to approximate values
how to use loops and conditionals to adjust a search range
how to define a tolerance for accuracy
how to handle special cases like 0, 1, and negative numbers
how the bisection method is efficient and avoids brute force guessing

**example output:**
the square root of 16 is approximately 4.0

all scripts written personally to learn the *why* behind every line of code.
