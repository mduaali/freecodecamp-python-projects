### 06_arithmetic_arranger_project
**CERTIFICATION PROJECT**

**Files:**
arithmetic_arranger.py

**What It Does:**
This program arranges arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction) vertically and side-by-side, just like students do in primary school. It ensures proper alignment, spacing, and formatting. Optionally, it can also display the calculated answers when enabled.

**What I Learned:**
- how to parse and validate user input strings using .split()
- how to handle logical conditions for operators and input validation
- how to align text using .rjust() and manage consistent formatting
- how to build and join multiple formatted lines into a single string
- how optional arguments can toggle additional functionality in python
- how to construct a clean, readable output with string joins and loops
