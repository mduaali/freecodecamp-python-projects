## 03_case_converter_project  

**Files:**  
case_converter.py  

**What It Does:**  
This program converts strings written in camelCase or PascalCase into snake_case format.  
It demonstrates two different approaches to solving the same problem using both a for loop and list comprehension for a more compact and expressive solution.  

**Example:**  
Input:  aLongAndComplexString  
Output: a_long_and_complex_string  

**What I Learned:**  
how to detect uppercase characters and transform them dynamically  
how to use .isupper() and .lower() string methods  
how to build new strings step by step with lists and ''.join()  
how list comprehensions can replace loops to make code cleaner and more pythonic  
how .strip('_') removes extra underscores from edges
